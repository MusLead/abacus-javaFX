## Program History and Conclusion

Sequence of design a programm:
1. Visualize how it will work
2. [Make a visualization app diagram](WireframesUML/Sempoa UML-class.drawio.png) 
3. [Make a UML Diagram (How the objects will communicate with each other!)](WireframesUML/Sempoa Wireframes Diagram.drawio.png) 

Sequence of Programming:
1. Create a project with gradle and creating a package name
2. Adjust dependencies with fulib
3. GenMode and generate Classes Objects
4. Make a AppServiceTest.java and write some simple logical test!
5. Make an AppService.java, where every process/algorithm is well written there
6. Adjust dependencies with JavaFX and JavaFXTest
7. Make UI with FXML ScreenBuilder (front-end)!
8. Apply all necessary Elements (App.class, Main.java, Constant.java, (Interface) Controller.class, and other controller)
9. Render every App, first form App in start() write down show(firstController.class)
10. before any complicated process, please test the button and whether every button works.
11. Complete the code with the process's planning.
12. Create Database
13. Test the Application (make sure also scrollPane also included!)
14. Evaluate the program

## My Notes
Message:
If you want fxml file to FXMLLoader. make sure when creating the folder in resources it writes / -> de/uniks/...

Some Notes for the future:

## TODO
TODO:
1. MAKE A TEST APP CIRCULATION! ERROR!
2. after a player is being saved and added to the code it will the screen will be deactivated!
